# 2019 Advent of Code

My solutions for the [2019 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019).

## Folder layout

Each days solution has its own folder `./day##/` with a complete copy any
supporting files and classes as they were when I solved the puzzle. Any followup
retries of a puzzle will be placed in a folder `./day##_attempt#/`

Solution folders typically contain the following:

| File               | Description                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `input.txt`        | My input for the day's puzzle                                                                      |
| `puzzle1.py`       | The puzzle solution for part one of the day's puzzle                                               |
| `puzzle2.py`       | The puzzle solution for part two of the day's puzzle. Usually it's a modified copy of `puzzle1.py` |
| `test.txt`         | A scratch file for testing input                                                                   |
| `util.py`          | Utility library from template folder                                                               |
| `SantaInteropt.py` | The interopt computer first described in day02                                                     |


The `./day00/` folder holds the most up to date version of all support files. It is
updated with a copy of anything useful created during the puzzle of the day
before the next puzzle is attempted. Usually this is done not long after
commiting the day's solution.
